Hello! ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about blending technology and education to create impactful digital learning experiences. With a background in School Digitization, I focus on Professional Learning with Digital Education Tools, developing engaging Lesson Ideas, and managing Mobile Device deployment for a seamless learning environment. I'm also diving deeper into Cloud Engineering and expanding my skills as I continue my journey in Learning to Code. 

When I'm not working on tech projects, I enjoy drawing and making musicâ€”creative outlets that help me bring fresh ideas to my work.

Feel free to explore my projects, and letâ€™s connect if you share similar interests!
