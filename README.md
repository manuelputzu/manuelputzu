Hello! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm passionate about Cloud Engineering and its role in shaping scalable, efficient, and innovative digital solutions. With a background in School Digitization, Iâ€™ve worked on integrating Digital Education Tools, Mobile Device Management, and developing engaging Lesson Ideas to enhance learning experiences. Now, Iâ€™m diving deeper into Cloud Technologies, DevOps, and Infrastructure as Code to expand my expertise in modern IT solutions.

When Iâ€™m not building in the cloud, I enjoy drawing and making music, creative outlets that inspire fresh ideas in my projects.

Feel free to explore my work, and letâ€™s connect if youâ€™re passionate about cloud technology and digital innovation!
